        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "  -A dictionary stores data in the form of key–value pairs.\n",
        "  -Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",
        "  -Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated.\n",
        "  -Internally, Python uses a hash table to store and access data quickly.\n",
        "  -Each key is converted into a hash value.\n",
        "  -This hash decides where the value is stored in memory.\n",
        "  -Lookup, insert, and delete operations are very fast (average O(1) time).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "  -No duplicates allowed\n",
        "   Sets automatically remove duplicates, so they’re useful when you want a collection of unique items.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Faster membership testing (in operator)\n",
        "   Checking if something exists in a set is much faster than in a list, especially when the collection is large.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Set operations\n",
        "   Sets support math-like operations such as union (|), intersection (&), and difference (-), which lists don’t directly provide.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "  -String: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (\"Hello\", 'Python').\n",
        "   List: A collection of items (can be numbers, strings, objects, etc.) enclosed in square brackets ([1, 2, 3]).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Strings: immutable (cannot be changed in place), only store characters.\n",
        "   Lists: mutable (can be modified), can store mixed data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "  -Tuples in Python ensure data integrity mainly because they are immutable:\n",
        "   Immutable → Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\\\n",
        "\n",
        "   why this ensures data integrity:\n",
        "  - If you pass a tuple to a function, you know its contents will stay the same.\n",
        "  -Useful for storing constant values, configuration, or data that must not change.\n",
        "  - Tuples can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot), since they’re hashable and stable.\n",
        "  - This means the data inside a tuple stays fixed throughout the program, preventing accidental modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "  -Hash Table:\n",
        "   A data structure that stores key–value pairs. It uses a hash function to convert each key into an index (a number), which decides where the value is stored in memory. This makes lookups, insertions, and deletions very fast (on average O(1) time).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Dictionaries in Python:\n",
        "  Python’s built-in dict type is implemented using a hash table.\n",
        "  Keys are hashed to find where to store their values.\n",
        "  When you do my_dict[\"name\"], Python hashes \"name\" and quickly jumps to the right location instead of searching through everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Yes ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, lists can contain elements of different data types because Python lists are dynamic and don’t enforce type restrictions.\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [5, 6]]\n",
        "print(my_list)\n",
        "# [1, 'hello', 3.14, True, [5, 6]]\n",
        "\n",
        "10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "  -Strings are immutable in Python because:\n",
        "\n",
        "a.Memory & efficiency\n",
        "Python stores strings in memory in a way that allows them to be shared and reused (string interning).\n",
        "If strings were mutable, changing one string could unexpectedly affect other variables pointing to the same string.\n",
        "\n",
        "b.Hashing & dictionary keys\n",
        "Strings are often used as keys in dictionaries (hash tables).\n",
        "For hashing to work, the key must never change. Immutability guarantees a string’s hash value stays constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "c.Safety & predictability\n",
        "Since strings are frequently used in programs, making them immutable prevents accidental changes and makes code more reliable.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "s = \"hello\"\n",
        "# s[0] = \"H\"  Error: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "\n",
        "# Instead, create a new string\n",
        "s = \"H\" + s[1:]\n",
        "print(s)  # Hello\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "  -Dictionaries can be more powerful than lists for some tasks because they store data as key–value pairs instead of just values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of dictionaries over lists:\n",
        "a.Fast lookups\n",
        "Accessing a value by key in a dictionary is on average O(1) (constant time) using hashing.\n",
        "In a list, searching for a value takes O(n) (linear time).\n",
        "\n",
        "students = {\"Alice\": 85, \"Bob\": 90}\n",
        "print(students[\"Alice\"])  # Fast lookup\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "b.Meaningful keys instead of positions\n",
        "Dictionaries use keys (like \"name\", \"age\") instead of numeric indexes (0, 1, 2).\n",
        "This makes code more readable and intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "person = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "# vs\n",
        "person_list = [\"John\", 25]\n",
        "\n",
        "c.Flexible data organization\n",
        "Dictionaries let you group related data without worrying about order.\n",
        "Adding/removing entries doesn’t shift indexes like in lists.\n",
        "No need to remember positions\n",
        "With a list, you must know the index of the item.\n",
        "With a dictionary, you just use the key (like \"id\", \"score\").\n",
        "\n",
        "12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "Scenario: Storing the latitude and longitude of a location.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why tuple is better:\n",
        "Coordinates should never change once recorded.\n",
        "A tuple is immutable, so the data can’t be accidentally modified.\n",
        "Tuples are also hashable, so they can be used as keys in a dictionary.\n",
        "# Using tuple for fixed data\n",
        "location = (28.6139, 77.2090)  # Delhi coordinates\n",
        "# Using it as a dictionary key\n",

        "\n",
        "13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "In Python, sets automatically remove duplicates because they only store unique elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}\n",
        "print(numbers)  \n",
        "# {1, 2, 3, 4}  → duplicates removed\n",
        "When you add a duplicate value:\n",
        "s = {10, 20}\n",
        "s.add(20)  \n",
        "print(s)  \n",
        "# {10, 20} → no change\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "Sets use hashing to check if an element already exists.\n",
        "If it does, the new duplicate is ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "So:\n",
        "Lists → allow duplicates.\n",
        "Sets → keep only unique items.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "  -The in keyword checks for membership, but it behaves differently for lists and dictionaries:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ For lists:\n",
        "in checks if a value exists in the list.\n",
        "It searches element by element (linear search, O(n) time).\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "print(\"apple\" in fruits)   # True\n",
        "print(\"mango\" in fruits)   # False\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ For dictionaries:\n",
        "in checks if a key exists in the dictionary (not the value).\n",
        "Uses hashing, so it’s very fast (O(1) average time).\n",
        "student = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20}\n",
        "print(\"name\" in student)     # True  (key check)\n",
        "print(\"Alice\" in student)    # False (value not checked)\n",
        "\n",
        "15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "Tuples are immutable → once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "This immutability ensures data integrity and allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets (because they’re hashable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "t = (10, 20, 30)\n",

        "\n",
        "16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "  -A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values can themselves be dictionaries.\n",
        "  It’s like a dictionary inside another dictionary, useful for representing hierarchical or structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example use case: Student database\n",

        "✅ Real-life use cases:\n",
        "Storing student records (as shown above).\n",
        "Representing JSON-like data (common in APIs).\n",
        "Organizing configuration settings with multiple levels (e.g., database configs)\n",

        "17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "  -Accessing elements in a Python dictionary:\n",
        "Dictionary lookup is based on hashing.\n",
        "When you do my_dict[key], Python:\n",

        "\n",
        "⏱️ Time Complexity:\n",
        "Average case: O(1) → constant time (very fast).\n",
        "Worst case: O(n) → happens rarely, only if many keys end up in the same hash bucket (hash collisions).\n",

        "\n",
        "18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "-Order matters\n",
        "Lists preserve the exact sequence of elements (insertion order).\n",
        "Example: storing steps in a recipe or items in a to-do list.\n",

        "Example: keeping track of multiple orders of the same item.\n",
        "orders = [\"burger\", \"pizza\", \"burger\", \"fries\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Index-based access\n",
        "Lists are great when you want to access items by their position.\n",
        "Example: get the 3rd element.\n",

        "\n",
        "19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "  -A dictionary stores data using a hash table.\n",
        "Keys are mapped to positions in memory using their hash value, not their insertion position.\n",
        "Because of this, the order of items isn’t guaranteed by the data structure itself (at least conceptually).\n",
